## Self-Evaluation
### 1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
So far, I feel fairly confident with what we have covered on arrays and their methods.
### 2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I think that having the link to the documentation saved will be very helpful if there is anything more about arrays and array methods I want to look into, and I might explore array methods further to see if there are any other interesting/useful ones I haven't looked at yet.
### 3. What questions do you have about Arrays?
I guess a question I would have would be how to further use arrays like how to iterate over an array in ruby, but I think that will be covered in the next lessons. Otherwise, I don't currently have more questions.
